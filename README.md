# NoteStats 
NoteStats is an Obsidian plugin, which enablew users to parse and analyse repeating custom fields in their daily notes. These fields will be entirely provided by the user, with a type for each. Based on the name and type, the plugin will go over all files in a specified folder, parse stats from them. This will be displayed as embedded charts in Obsidian, so users can see visually how their metrict changed over time.
This will have a free and paid version, free being good on it's own, but paid offering extra insights and statistics and automation to our daily notes.
